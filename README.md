# Cruise-Line-Prediction-and-Deployment-Using-Flask-Postman-

 ðŸ©» Data Scientist Project (1)



ðŸ”´ Language: Python

ðŸ”´ Deployment: Flask (Postman)

ðŸ”´ Project Objective: Predict whether customers will choose to travel with the cruise line again using data analysis and machine learning.



ðŸ”´ Libraries and Tools Used:

Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For handling numerical computations.

Seaborn and Matplotlib: For creating insightful visualizations.



ðŸ”´ Data Cleaning:

- Renamed columns to improve clarity and consistency.

- Addressed and corrected any negative values in the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.



ðŸ”´ Data Transformation:

- Performed validation to ensure the dataset was accurate and complete before further analysis.



ðŸ”´ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Key Findings:



âœ… Room Type Distribution:

The analysis shows that "Interior" was the most frequently booked room type.



âœ… Customer Loyalty:

50.7% of customers indicated they would travel with the cruise line again, while 49.3% indicated they would not.



âœ… Cost by Room Type:

The "Interior" room type had the highest overall cost in comparison to other room types.



âœ… Shipboard Expenses:

Customers in "Interior" rooms also incurred the highest shipboard expenses.



âœ… Room Cost Distribution:

The cost analysis revealed that "Interior" rooms consistently had the highest room costs.



âœ… Correlation Between Satisfaction and Overall Trip Experience:

A heatmap revealed a strong positive correlation between the average customer satisfaction score across all questions and the overall trip satisfaction rating, indicating that improving customer satisfaction in specific areas could directly enhance overall trip satisfaction.



ðŸ©» Business Recommendations:



âœ… Optimize Room Inventory Based on Demand:

Since "Interior" rooms are the most frequently booked and generate the highest costs, the cruise line should focus on optimizing inventory and pricing for these rooms to maximize revenue.



âœ… Enhance Customer Retention Strategies:

With nearly half of customers hesitant to travel again, targeted loyalty programs, personalized offers, and improved satisfaction strategies could help increase repeat travel rates.



âœ… Improve Onboard Experiences for High-Cost Rooms:

Given that "Interior" rooms also show the highest shipboard expenses, the cruise line could offer additional premium services or packages to customers in these rooms to enhance the onboard experience and increase spending.



âœ… Leverage Satisfaction Data for Marketing:

Since customer satisfaction strongly influences overall trip satisfaction, using this data for targeted marketing campaigns could help attract more loyal customers, emphasizing high customer satisfaction rates in advertising efforts.
